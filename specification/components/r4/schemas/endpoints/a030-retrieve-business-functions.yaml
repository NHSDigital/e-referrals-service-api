  ## Overview
  
  Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of available e-RS roles (i.e. business functions) at each organisation where the user works.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated user

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve a list of authorised e-RS roles for organisations I work for

  So I can choose the appropriate role and organisation to work under when performing tasks.

  ## Related endpoints

  You can then use the e-RS roles to perform specific tasks using other e-RS endpoints e.g. to satisfy Role and Organisation validation.

  ### Role and Organisation Validation

  The response from a successful call to [[HYPERLINK_A030]] represents a Practitioner Role Bundle. 
  Each Practitioner Role represents an e-RS Role at a specific Organisation. 
  
  For most e-RS endpoints requests are made in the context of a specific authorised e-RS Role at a specific Organisation for the authenticated user. 
  This is accomplished by setting the values of the `NHSD-eRS-Business-Function` and `NHSD-End-User-Organisation-ODS` request headers. 
  
  The e-RS Role is supplied to the endpoint via the `NHSD-eRS-Business-Function` request header. 
  
  The Organisation is supplied to the endpoint via the `NHSD-End-User-Organisation-ODS` request header. 

  The `entry` field in the response from [[HYPERLINK_A030]] is an array of PractitionerRole resources. An example of a PractitionerRole resource is: 
  ```
  "resource": {
    "id": "PractitionerRole-R69-000000000101",
    "meta": {
      "lastUpdated": "2021-05-24T16:09:32.252Z"
    },
    "resourceType": "PractitionerRole",
    "practitioner": {
      "identifier": {
        "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-user-id",
        "value": "000000000101"
      }
    },
    "organization": {
      "identifier": {
        "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code",
        "value": "R69"
      }
    },
    "code": [
      {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/eRS-BusinessFunction-1",
            "code": "SERVICE_DEFINER"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/eRS-BusinessFunction-1",
            "code": "SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/eRS-BusinessFunction-1",
            "code": "SERVICE_PROVIDER_ADMIN"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  ```
  Each PractitionerRole resource has a `code` field which is an array of codings. 
  The authorised e-RS Roles for the authenticated user at a particular Organisation are represented by the `value` fields in the `https://fhir.nhs.uk/CodeSystem/eRS-BusinessFunction-1` code system. 
  The `NHSD-eRS-Business-Function` request header value should be the `code` field value from the relevant eRS-Business-Function-1 coding in the PractitionerRole resource e.g. `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`.

  Each PractitionerRole resource also has an `organization` field which has an identifier in the `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code` code system.
  The `NHSD-End-User-Organisation-ODS` request header value should be the `value` field value from the organization identifier in the PractitionerRole resource e.g. "R69".
