  ## Overview
  
  A patient may have 0 to 20 services associated with a single referral. A service is a place where a referrer can send a patient or obtain clinical 
  advice concerning a specific patient. Services have attributes that can be used to understand a services functionality, terms of use, and contact 
  information. 
  You can use this endpoint to obtain the current version and attributes of a single service.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted, unattended access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
