  ## Overview
  
  A Patient may have 0 to 20 Services associated with a single referral. 
  A service is a place where a referrer can send a patient or obtain clinical advice concerning a specific patient. 
  You can use this endpoint to obtain a set of services (up to 20) and their associated attributes, in a single call. 

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
