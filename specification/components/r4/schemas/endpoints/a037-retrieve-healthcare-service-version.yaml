  ## Overview
  A Patient may have 0 to 20 services associated with a single referral. 
  A service is a place where a referrer can send a patient or obtain clinical advice concerning a specific patient.
  
  You can use this endpoint to obtain the current service's "version" held in e-RS, in order to compare to a locally cached version. 

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to have identified one service ID in order to use this endpoint.
  
  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I would like to be able to see the current information about a service on my patients current shortlist

  So that I can review and trust the information is still valid within the context of my patients needs
  
  ## Related endpoints
