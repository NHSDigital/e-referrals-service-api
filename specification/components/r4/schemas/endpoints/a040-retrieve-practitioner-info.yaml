        ## Overview
        
        Use this endpoint to determine which e-RS users a `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` is allowed to work "on-behalf-of".

        Note: In e-RS, `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` users always act "on-behalf-of" a `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`. This endpoint specifically helps `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` identify who they are allowed to log in as.

        ## Supported security patterns
        - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

        ## Pre-requisites
        To use this endpoint, you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles depending on the query being invoked:

        | Query                                                                | e-RS Role(s)                      |
        | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
        | onBehalfOf                                                           | `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` |

        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user who has the `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` role

        I need to know which provider clinical users I am allowed to work "on-behalf-of" at my provider organisation

        So I can log in as a `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` user and complete tasks on behalf of a chosen `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN` user.

        ## Related endpoints

        To perform actions as a `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` user, you must provide one of the returned Practitioner IDs, in the `NHSD-eRS-On-Behalf-Of-User-ID` header parameter, to indicate which `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN` the call is on-behalf-of.
