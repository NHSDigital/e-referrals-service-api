  The e-Referral service APIs limit the number of transactions you can make per unit of time.
  This protects our service against excessive use and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and is also to encourage you to use our APIs efficiently.

  Our standard rate limit for the production environment is 10 requests per second per application.
  APIs associated with the "Binary" resource are further restricted to 2 requests per second per application.
  If you go over the rate limit you'll receive a response with an HTTP status of 429 (Too Many Requests).

  Our path-to-live environments have very low rate limits.
  They are for functional testing only - you should not use them for [[HYPERLINK_PERFORMANCE_TESTING]].

  If you have problems with rate limits, [[HYPERLINK_CONTACT_US]] to discuss your application design and volumetrics,
  and to see whether it's appropriate to raise your rate limit.

  If a 429 response is received, indicating a request has been rate limited, then you must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests.
  Once a request is successful again, then you may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits.

  Example:
    - Receive a 429 response
    - Wait 1s and resend, but still receive a 429
    - Wait 2s and resend, but still receive a 429
    - Wait 4s, request is successful
    - Return to normal request cadence
