  When a client receives a 429 response, indicating it has been rate limited,
  the client must back off and retry with exponentially increasing periods between requests.
  Once a request is successful again, the client may continue to send requests inline with the documented rate limits
  (see [rate limit](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#rate-limits)).
  Example:

    1)  Client receives a 429 response
    2)  Client waits 1s and resends, but still receives a 429
    3)  Client waits 2s and resends, but still receives a 429
    4)  Client waits 4s, request is successful
    5)  Return to normal request cadence
