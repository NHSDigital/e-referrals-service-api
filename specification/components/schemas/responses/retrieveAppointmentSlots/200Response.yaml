  The Response contains a FHIR 'Bundle' that, in turn, contains 'Slot' resources where each 'Slot' resource includes the 'Reference' to the slot and the slot's 'start' and 'end' times.

  The Response Bundle also contains one or more 'Schedule' resources each of which is used to indicate which allocated clinician a Slot is associated with (if any). 
  The 'Schedule' also indicates the Service Id that will be the same Service for which the Slot search was performed.
