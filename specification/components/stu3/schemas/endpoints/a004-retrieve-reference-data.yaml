  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of reference data codes along with the user-friendly display values used in the e-RS Professional Application.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted, unattended access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  ### Application-restricted access 
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application.

  ### Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user or application

  I need to retrieve e-RS reference data

  So I can use it with other endpoints or display the reference data in a user-friendly format to my users.
  
  ## Related endpoints
  Reference data may be needed for other endpoints, for example when including Specialty and Clinic Type reference data to:
  - find services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]], and
  - create a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A011]]

  You can use the Priority reference data to calculate when a patient can expect to be contacted by the service. 

  This is important because when a patient's appointment is deferred to a service to book, the patient may be informed of the date by which they can expect to be contacted. 
  Similarly, in the case of a triage service, a letter may inform the patient of the date by which they can expect to be contacted.

  You can calculate this date by:

  1. Obtaining the current priority of the referral (via [[HYPERLINK_A005]]) and its associated "deferToProviderContactDays" (for deferred-to services) or "triageContactDays" (for triage services). These represent the number of "working days" and do not include weekends
  2. Obtaining the datetime of the appointment resource, e.g. "created" : "2021-05-06T11:21:45.652Z"
  3. Adding the "working days" to the datetime of the appointment resource
  
    For example:

  1. Given a referral with a priority of `TWO_WEEK_WAIT` and a "deferToProviderContactDays" of "2" for priority `TWO_WEEK_WAIT`
  2. If the appointment was created on Monday 03/01/2022 for a deferred-to service 
  3. The calculated date when a patient can expect to be contacted by the service would be on or before 05/01/2022

  Note that the "deferToProviderContactDays" and "triageContactDays" values are dynamic, and may change independently from one another, so the above calculation is for illustration purposes only.

  You may also wish to present the user-friendly names for the reference data, for example when viewing the referral using [[HYPERLINK_A005]] and [[HYPERLINK_A038]].
  
  Documentation for other endpoints will reference this endpoint, where specific reference data is required.
