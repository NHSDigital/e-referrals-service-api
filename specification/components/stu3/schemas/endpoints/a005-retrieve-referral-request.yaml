  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve details of a referral. This includes references to clinical attachments, related referrals and other important data.

  During the lifecycle of a referral, the state of the referral may change multiple times. To help with understanding the state of a referral, we provide an "at a glance" summary of the referral as detailed below:

  | Code returned via https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/eRS-ReferralState-1 | Description                                                                                          |

  | `AWAITING_TRIAGE`                                                         | The triage referral is currently pending review with a service provider                              |
  | `BOOKED`                                                                  | This referral's appointment indicates a date and time with a service                                 |

  | `DID_NOT_ATTEND`                                                          | The patient did not attend their last appointment                                                    |

  | `TRIAGED_PROVIDER_TO_ACTION`                                              | The service provider has recorded a review decision, with the intention of processing this referral  |

  Some referral states may also have a `reason` and some reasons may also have a `comment`.  These are described below:

  ## Reason
  - The reason is always connected to the current state. This means the reason is likely to change each time the state changes. You cannot currently retrieve previous versions of a referral.
  - This reason may have been selected by a clinician or automatically applied by the e-RS system at the time the state was persisted.
  - A reason can be dynamic reference data, from any of the following sets of reference data: `APPOINTMENT-CANCELLATION-REASON`, `REFERRAL-CANCELLATION-REASON`, `APPOINTMENT-NON-ATTENDANCE-REASON`. These are retrievable from [[HYPERLINK_A004]].
  - A reason may be static reference data.

  ## Comments
  - The comment is always connected to the current reason, and state. This means the comment is likely to change as the state changes.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  ### Application-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application.

  ### Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user or application and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of a referral request in order to retrieve details of a referral.

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user or application

  I want to read details of a referral

  So that I can decide what further action may be needed.
