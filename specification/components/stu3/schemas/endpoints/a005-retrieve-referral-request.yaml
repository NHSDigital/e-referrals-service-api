  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve details of a referral. This includes references to clinical attachments, related referrals and other important data.

  During the lifecycle of a referral, the state of the referral may change multiple times. To help with understanding the state of a referral, we provide an "at a glance" summary of the referral as detailed below:

  | Code returned via https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/eRS-ReferralState-1 | Description                                                                                          |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `APPT_CANCELLED_BY_PATIENT`                                               | The referral's most recent appointment was cancelled at the request of, or directly by, a patient    |
  | `APPT_CANCELLED_BY_PROVIDER`                                              | The referral's most recent appointment was cancelled by the service provider                         |
  | `ASSESSMENT_RESULT`                                                       | A service provider has reviewed and drafted, or submitted a clinical assessment for the referral     |
  | `AWAITING_TRIAGE`                                                         | The triage referral is currently pending review with a service provider                              |
  | `BOOKED`                                                                  | This referral's appointment indicates a date and time with a service                                 |
  | `CANCELLED_REFERRAL`                                                      | The referral has been cancelled and cannot be progressed any further                                 |
  | `DEFERRED_TO_PROVIDER`                                                    | The service provider will arrange the patient's appointment                                          |
  | `DID_NOT_ATTEND`                                                          | The patient did not attend their last appointment                                                    |
  | `NOT_BOOKED`                                                              | The referral is currently not booked, there is currently no planned patient encounter                |
  | `REJECTED`                                                                | The referral was rejected by a provider at their service                                             |
  | `TRIAGE_RESPONSE`                                                         | A service has passed the referral back to the referrer, with advice                                  |
  | `TRIAGED_PROVIDER_TO_ACTION`                                              | The service provider has recorded a review decision, with the intention of processing this referral  |

  Some referral states may also have a `reason` and some reasons may also have a `comment`.  These are described below:

  ## Reason
  - The reason is always connected to the current state. This means the reason is likely to change each time the state changes. You cannot currently retrieve previous versions of a referral.
  - This reason may have been selected by a clinician or automatically applied by the e-RS system at the time the state was persisted.
  - A reason can be dynamic reference data, from any of the following sets of reference data: `APPOINTMENT-CANCELLATION-REASON`, `REFERRAL-CANCELLATION-REASON`, `APPOINTMENT-NON-ATTENDANCE-REASON`. These are retrievable from [[HYPERLINK_A004]].
  - A reason may be static reference data.

  ## Comments
  - The comment is always connected to the current reason, and state. This means the comment is likely to change as the state changes.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  
  ## Pre-requisites
  ### Application-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application, working in the context of a Service Provider Organisation.

  ### Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user or application and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of a referral request in order to retrieve details of a referral.

  ## Important notes
  ### Attachment availability

   In order to retrieve an attachment using the [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]) endpoint, the attachment must be available for download. Attachments are only made available once an uploaded file has been validated and successfully malware scanned. A request to retrieve an attachment that is not available for download will result in an error being returned. See [[HYPERLINK_A042]] for more information.

  The availability status of an attachment can be retrieved via any endpoint that returns an eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code in the success response, including [[HYPERLINK_A005]]. The eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code can return one of four possible values, as detailed below.

  | eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code | Description / Guidance                                                                                            |
  |-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | AVAILABLE                     | The file is available for download.                                                                               |
  | PENDING                       | The file is being scanned and cannot be retrieved. Wait at least 5 minutes before checking its availability again |
  | THREATS FOUND                 | The file has been quarantined after detecting a threat and cannot be retrieved.<br> Contact the organisation that uploaded the file to resolve the issue and get the information you need. Use the extensions returned via this endpoint: Extension-eRS-AttachedBy-1 and Extension-eRS-AttachedByOrganisation-1. |
  | VALIDATION_FAILED             | The file has failed validation and cannot be retrieved.<br> Contact the organisation that uploaded the file to resolve the issue and get the information you need. Use the extensions returned via this endpoint: Extension-eRS-AttachedBy-1 and Extension-eRS-AttachedByOrganisation-1. Validation can fail because the: <ul><li>content type of the file is not supported</li><li>content type of the file does not correlate with the file extension</li><li>file provided is too large and is not supported by e-RS. Note, this indicates that the file size is larger than the system supports as a whole, not the 5MB limit associated with this endpoint</li></ul> |

  ### Receiving an e-Referral Pathway Start Date
   
  The e-Referral Pathway Start Date is a derived value of when the Referral To Treatment (RTT) clock starts. Find out how e-RS derives the pathway start date [[HYPERLINK_PATHWAY_START]].
  
  If a referral was created with an alternate pathway start date, then this will be available in the referral request response.
  
  Service providers must always ensure the correct start date is recorded in line with [[HYPERLINK_RTT_RULES]].

  ## Use case
 
  As an authenticated user or application

  I want to read details of a referral

  So that I can decide what further action may be needed.

  ## Related endpoints

  You can retrieve attachments that are associated with the referral using [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]. Attachments can only be retrieved where the eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code returned is 'AVAILABLE'

  You can retrieve a clinical information summary for the referral using [[HYPERLINK_A007]]

  You can search for services appropriate to a referral to form a shortlist using [[HYPERLINK_A010]]

  If bookable services are on the shortlist of the referral, you can retrieve appointment slots for a service on the shortlist for a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A015]]

  You can retrieve the patient letter appropriate to the referral using [[HYPERLINK_A019]]

  You can retrieve reference data used in viewing a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A004]]
