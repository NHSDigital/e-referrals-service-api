  ## Overview
  
  Use this endpoint to retrieve a file that is attached to a referral or advice request.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access


  ## Pre-requisites
  ### Application-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application.

  ### Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user or application and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to have retrieved the referral via [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to obtain the URLs for its attachments.

  ## Important note

  A referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. 
  For example, a referral is booked and seen in a general knee clinical assessment service (UBRN #1), 
  and the service decides to onward refer to a more specialist knee miniscus service (UBRN #2). 
  This would result in two UBRNs for the referral pathway in this example (but there could be more related UBRNs if onward referred multiple times).

  As such, it is important that all clinical information is obtained from across all the related UBRNs referenced in [[HYPERLINK_A005]]. 
  You can do this using the following endpoints:

    - [[HYPERLINK_A007]]
    - [[HYPERLINK_A006]]

  Note: It is possible that the initial UBRN may be the only one in the referral pathway to have clinical information and/or attachments associated.
  
  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve a clinical attachment associated with a referral

  So that I can assess its content and decide what further action may be needed.

  ## Related endpoints
  
  You can retrieve a clinical information summary for a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A007]].
