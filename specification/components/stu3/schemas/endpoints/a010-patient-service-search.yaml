  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to find services that meet the referral needs of a patient.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to have identified a `patient`, for example via [[HYPERLINK_PDS]].

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to find services I can refer the patient to

  So that I can offer the patient appropriate services that meet their referral needs

  ## Important Notes
  If using this endpoint for modifying an existing Referral (such as via the [[HYPERLINK_A031]] endpoint for example), you will need to provide the Commissioning Rule Organisation parameter. This ensures that the services returned in the response are valid for use with the Referral. You can obtain the 'Commissioning Rule Organisation' from [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

  ## Related endpoints
  Once you have identified appropriate services for the patient you can create a referral by choosing a shortlist of bookable and/or triage services using [[HYPERLINK_A011]]. You may then subsequently be able to use [[HYPERLINK_A016]] to book an appointment to a directly bookable service if an appointment slot is available, defer the booking responsibility to a directly bookable service if no appointment slot is available, or refer a patient into a triage service.
