  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to find services that meet the referral needs of a patient.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to have identified a `patient`, for example via [[HYPERLINK_PDS]].

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to find services I can refer the patient to

  So that I can offer the patient appropriate services that meet their referral needs

  ## Related endpoints
  Once you have identified appropriate services for the patient you can create a referral by choosing a shortlist of bookable and/or triage services using [[HYPERLINK_A011]]. You may then subsequently be able to use [[HYPERLINK_A016]] to book an appointment to a directly bookable service if an appointment slot is available, defer the booking responsibility to a directly bookable service if no appointment slot is available, or refer a patient into a triage service.
