  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to create a referral by choosing a shortlist of bookable services and/or triage services.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  
  ## Important notes when creating a referral
  The maximum amount of services allowed on a given shortlist is 20.
  
  The act of shortlisting alone will not result in a referral being sent/booked to any of the shortlisted services (even if only one service is shortlisted). 
  Use [[HYPERLINK_A016]] if there is a need to support the sending/booking of the referral into a shortlisted service.

  ## Important notes when sending an e-Referral Pathway Start Date
  The e-Referral Pathway Start Date is a derived value of when the Referral To Treatment (RTT) clock starts. Find out how e-RS derives the pathway start date [[HYPERLINK_PATHWAY_START]].
  
  You can supply an optional, alternate pathway start date when creating a referral.
  
  This may be because steps, such as reviews, take place early in your business process. Which means the clock started earlier than when the e-RS referral is created. 
  Providing an alternate pathway start date ensures the correct date is recorded and used in other systems.

  When provided, the pathway start date must be:
    - in the past
    - no longer than 365 days ago
    - calculated in line with [[HYPERLINK_RTT_RULES]]
  
  This also overrides any e-RS derived date.
  
  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to have identified a `patient`, for example via [[HYPERLINK_PDS]].

  You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]].

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to create a shortlist of bookable services and/or triage services

  So I can initiate my patients referral pathway, allowing the patient to book into one of the shortlisted services.

  ## Related endpoints

  To allow the patient to progress their referral in their own time, you can generate a letter for the patient by 
  using [[HYPERLINK_A019]]. The letter summarises the current state of the referral and any steps the 
  patient may need to follow (e.g. appointment booking instructions).

  You can book an appointment for the patient into a shortlisted directly bookable service using [[HYPERLINK_A015]] and [[HYPERLINK_A016]].
  
  You can send the referral into a shortlisted triage service using [[HYPERLINK_A016]]. 

  For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].

  You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], [[HYPERLINK_A007]], and [[HYPERLINK_A006]] endpoints where necessary.

  You can generate a letter for the patient, which summarises the current state of their referral and any steps the patient may need to follow, by using [[HYPERLINK_A019]].
