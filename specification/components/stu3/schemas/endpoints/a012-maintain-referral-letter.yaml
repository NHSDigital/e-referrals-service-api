  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to manage the set of 'referral letter' attachments associated with an existing referral, including adding or removing attachments from a referral.

  Whilst a document can be uploaded via [[HYPERLINK_A020]] without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID`, only documents that have a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` can be associated using this end point. 
  An attempt to associate a document without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` will return an error response of 422 - `INAPPROPRIATE_VALUE`.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  All new files to be associated with a referral must be uploaded first using [[HYPERLINK_A020]] and then linked to the referral using this endpoint.

  ## Important information about using this endpoint
  
  This endpoint can be used to associate attachments to a referral that has no existing referral letter attachments. 
  In this case you must upload the file first using [[HYPERLINK_A020]] and then associate it to the referral using this endpoint.

  You can also use this endpoint to modify the *set* of referral letter attachments already associated with a referral. 
  In this case, you must post all referral letter attachments you wish to be (finally) associated to the referral, 
  including any that were already associated. In other words, this endpoint replaces the set of referral letter 
  attachments previously associated - with those specified in your latest request. 
  As such, it is imperative that this call references all the attachments the user wishes to keep, every time it is called.

  Below are three example scenarios which clarify the behaviour of the endpoint when referral attachments are already present on the referral:

  1. Let us consider a referral that has two referral letter attachments associated (say "A.pdf" and "B.pdf"). If 
  you wish to add an additional attachment (say "C.pdf"), you must upload the additional attachment 
  "C.pdf" using [[HYPERLINK_A020]], and then associate attachments "A.pdf", "B.pdf" and "C.pdf" 
  via this endpoint in a single request. That is, all three attachments "A.pdf", "B.pdf" and "C.pdf" 
  must be included in the request to [[HYPERLINK_A012]].
  2. Let us consider a different referral that has two referral letter attachments (say "D.jpg" and "E.jpg") 
  already associated, and you wish to remove one of them. Let us consider that you wish to remove "D.jpg". 
  To do this, you would call [[HYPERLINK_A012]] specifying only "E.jpg" in your request. By omitting 
  "D.jpg" from your request, e-RS will disassociate attachment "D.jpg" from the referral and only attachment "E.jpg" 
  will remain associated.
  3. Let us now consider a referral that has four referral letter attachments associated (say "L.doc", "M.doc", "N.doc" 
  and "O.doc"), and you wish to add some more files (say "P.doc" and "Q.doc") and remove some files (say "N.doc" 
  and "O.doc"). To do this you must upload the additional attachment(s) ("N.doc" and "O.doc") 
  using [[HYPERLINK_A020]]. Following that successful upload, you must then associate only all 
  referral letter attachments the user wishes to keep (namely "L.doc", "M.doc", "P.doc" and "Q.doc") 
  in a single request to [[HYPERLINK_A012]]. Attachments not included in the request 
  (namely "N.doc" and "O.doc") will be disassociated from the referral as a result.

  As a developer or software supplier, please ensure your users are made aware or protected from this behaviour. 
  For example, when a referring user wants to update the attachments on a referral, the user should be presented 
  with the currently associated attachments so they can add and/or remove attachments as required.

  Note: It is not permissible to remove *all* referral letter attachments leaving zero attachments associated. 
  There must be at least one referral letter attachment associated.

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to be able to manage referral letter attachments associated with a referral

  So I can ensure the service provider has enough information to review/process the referral.


  ## Related endpoints
  Documents must be uploaded into the e-RS document store using [[HYPERLINK_A020]] before they can be associated 
  with a referral.
  
  You can check to see what referral letter information has been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], 
  [[HYPERLINK_A007]], and [[HYPERLINK_A006]] endpoints where necessary.
