  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to accept a referral that is booked into your bookable service and awaiting review.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  ## Important notes
  
  In order to retrieve an attachment using the [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]) endpoint, the attachment must be available for download. 
  The availability status of attachments associated with a referral are returned via this endpoint as a eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code. 
  
  Further details on attachment availability status and eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 codes can be found in the [[HYPERLINK_A005]] and [[HYPERLINK_A042]] specifications.  
  
  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. [[HYPERLINK_A013]] can only be used for referrals 
  booked into bookable services, and not the referrals sent into triage services.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve the details for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A007]] to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

  ## Use cases
  As an authenticated user

  I need to accept an inbound referral after its review

  So that I can confirm the patient's referral is appropriate for the current service and booked appointment date/time.
