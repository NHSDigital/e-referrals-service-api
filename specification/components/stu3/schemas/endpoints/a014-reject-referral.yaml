  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to reject a referral that is booked into your bookable service and awaiting review. 
  This returns the referral to the referrer with a mandatory rejection reason and optional user comment to explain why it has been rejected.

  Consider using [[HYPERLINK_A022]] instead if you wish to ask your admin team to get the patient into the most appropriate service.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. [[HYPERLINK_A014]] can only 
  be used for referrals booked into bookable services, and not the referrals sent into triage services.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve the details for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A007]] to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A004]] to retrieve a list of rejection reason reference data codes along with their user-friendly display names.  To find 
  relevant rejection reasons, obtain reference data from `APPOINTMENT-CANCELLATION-REASON` and filter as follows:

    - `appointmentBookingCancellationReasonType` must be `PROVIDER_REJECT`
    - `effectiveFrom` must be in the past, and
    - `effectiveTo` must not be in the past

  ## Use cases
  As an authenticated user

  I need to reject an inbound referral back to the referrer after its review with an explanation of why

  So that the referrer can address the reason for rejection and progress the referral appropriately.
