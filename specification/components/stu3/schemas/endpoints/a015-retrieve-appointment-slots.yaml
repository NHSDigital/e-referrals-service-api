  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve available appointment slots for a service.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to have identified a directly bookable `service` that is on the current referral shortlist. You can do this by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve a list of available appointment slots for a service

  So that I can offer them to the patient for booking.

  ## Important note
  You need to provide the 'commissioning rule organisation' when calling [[HYPERLINK_A015]] to ensure only suitable slots are returned. You can obtain the 'commissioning rule organisation' from [[HYPERLINK_A005]].
  
  ## Related endpoints

  You can book an appointment to an available slot using [[HYPERLINK_A016]].

  You can defer booking to a directly bookable service using [[HYPERLINK_A016]] but only in the following circumstances:
    - when the service has no available slots
    - when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available
    - when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)

  ## Sandbox test scenarios

  You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:
