  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to book an appointment to a service if an appointment slot is available or defer booking if no appointment slot is available.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to check if the service is directly bookable by either using [[HYPERLINK_A033]] or [[HYPERLINK_A035]]. You can only book/defer into shortlisted services that are directly bookable currently. Note: In the future it will be possible to use this endpoint to defer into a shortlisted triage service.

  If the service is directly bookable, you need to retrieve available appointment slots for the service using [[HYPERLINK_A015]].

  You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint. 

  ## Important note when deferring to provider
  
  You should only defer booking to a directly bookable service in the following circumstances:
    - when the service has no available slots *or*
    - when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available *or*
    - when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within the message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to either:
    - book an appointment to an available appointment slot for a service *or*
    - defer booking responsibility for the service to the service provider if a booking is not possible

  So I can progress my patient's care at that service.

  ## Related endpoints
  You can generate a letter for the patient, summarising the current state of their referral and any steps 
  the patient may need to follow using [[HYPERLINK_A019]].

  You can calculate the date when the patient will need to be contacted (by the service) using reference data from [[HYPERLINK_A004]].
