  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to book an appointment to a directly bookable service if an appointment slot is available, defer the booking responsibility to a directly bookable service if no appointment slot is available, or refer a patient into a triage service. 

  It is not possible to book into an indirectly bookable service using this endpoint. The patient will need to contact the service provider on the telephone number provided on [[HYPERLINK_A019]].
  
  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to check if the service is directly bookable, indirectly bookable, or triage by either using [[HYPERLINK_A033]] or [[HYPERLINK_A035]].You can then offer the appropriate actions to authenticated users, i.e. the ability to book an appointment into a directly bookable service if an appointment slot is available, defer the booking responsibility to a directly bookable service if no appointment slot is available, refer a patient into a triage service.
  
  If the service is directly bookable, you need to retrieve available appointment slots for the service using [[HYPERLINK_A015]].

  You need to use the Unique Booking Reference Number (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint. 

  ## Important note when deferring to provider
  
  You should only defer booking to a directly bookable service in the following circumstances:
    - when the service has no available slots *or*
    - when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available *or*
    - when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within the message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to ba able to:
    - Book an appointment to an available appointment slot for a a directly bookable service *or*
    - Defer the booking responsibility to a directly bookable service if no appointment slot is available *or*
    - Refer the patient to a triage service

  So I can progress my patient's care at that service.

  ## Related endpoints
  You can generate a letter for the patient, summarising the current state of their referral and any steps 
  the patient may need to follow using [[HYPERLINK_A019]].

  Where deferring the booking responsibility to a directly bookable service, or referring the patient into a triage service, you can calculate the date when the patient can expect to be contacted (by the receiving service) using reference data from [[HYPERLINK_A004]].
