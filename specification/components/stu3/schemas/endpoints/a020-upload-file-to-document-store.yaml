  Currently, the maximum file size supported by e-RS is 5MB.

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to upload a referral letter or other clinical information file to e-RS

  So that I can associate the file with an existing referral.

  ## Important notes:

  This endpoint **only** performs the file upload. The uploaded file is **not** associated with a referral until the file has been associated with a referral, for example using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].
  
  The resulting URL within e-RS for the uploaded file is returned in the 'Location' header of the response.

  ## Related endpoints

  You can associate the uploaded file with a specific referral using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].
