  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to refer the patient directly to a triage service.

  Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist bookable services. In order to shortlist bookable services please use [[HYPERLINK_A011]].
  
  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to have identified a `patient`, for example via [[HYPERLINK_PDS]].

  You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]].

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to send the patient's referral to a triage service for assessment

  So that I can put the patient on the appropriate clinical pathway for the chosen service provider.

  ## Related endpoints

  For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].

  You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], [[HYPERLINK_A007]], and [[HYPERLINK_A006]] endpoints where necessary.

  You can generate a letter for the patient by using [[HYPERLINK_A019]]. 
  The letter summarises the current state of the referral and any steps the patient may need to follow.

  You can calculate the date when the patient will need to be contacted (by the triage service) using reference data from [[HYPERLINK_A004]].
