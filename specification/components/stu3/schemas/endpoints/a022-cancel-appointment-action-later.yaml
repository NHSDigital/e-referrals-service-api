  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to task your admin team to rebook/redirect a referral that is booked 
  into your bookable service and awaiting review.

  Note: this will also cancel the current appointment.

  Whilst a document can be uploaded via [[HYPERLINK_A020]] without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID`, only documents that have a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` can be associated using this end point. 
  An attempt to associate a document without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` will return an error response of 422 - `INAPPROPRIATE_VALUE`.
  
  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. [[HYPERLINK_A022]] can 
  only be used for referrals booked into bookable services, and not the referrals sent into triage services.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve the details for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A007]] to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

  If you want to include attachments with the admin task, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so they are 
  ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

  ## Use cases
  As an authenticated user

  I need to task my admin team to rebook/redirect a referral I have reviewed (whilst also cancelling the current appointment)

  So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.
  
  ## Important notes
    - The priority of the referral can be changed as part of this endpoint.
    - A comment must be added to explain to the administrator what is required and can include optional attachments.
    - The current appointment is cancelled as part of this endpoint. If the current appointment is booked to an indirectly
      bookable service, you must indicate whether the appointment has been cancelled on the local provider system. 
      If indicated as not cancelled, the referral will be added to the 'Indirectly Booked Appointments to Cancel in PAS' 
      worklist to task the admin team to do so.
    - When this endpoint is successfully used, an entry will be added to the service providers 'Appointments For Booking' 
      worklist for the admin team to action the task. The provider admin team will only be able to progress the referral 
      via the e-RS Professional Application user interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).
