  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve available worklists of advice and guidance requests. Use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve available worklists of referral requests.

  Worklists provide lists of referral/advice requests that meet certain criteria, typically where a user needs to be aware of something important, 
  or to undertake an action, in order to avoid delays to patient care.
  
  Service provider organisations can retrieve the contents of their 'Advice and guidance requests' worklist using 
  this endpoint. This worklist contains advice and guidance requests the provider has received and which need actioning.

  There are currently no advice and guidance related worklists available for referring organisations.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  If a worklist response exceeds 10MB, a successful response will not be returned. This is due to the size limitation on the APIM platform.
  
  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve a worklist of advice and guidance requests

  So I can determine which ones I need to take further action on.
