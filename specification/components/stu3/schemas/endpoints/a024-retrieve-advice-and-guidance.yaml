  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. This endpoint provides important 
  contextual information about the advice and guidance request (e.g. the service/specialty to which advice has been requested, etc).

  This does not include the actual advice and guidance conversation between the referrer and the service provider. 
  The conversation can be retrieved via [[HYPERLINK_A025]].

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted access, unattended access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. 
  For service provider users, you may have identified the UBRN via [[HYPERLINK_A023]].
   
  ## Application-restricted access

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application.

  ## Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user or application

  I need to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request

  So I can understand all of the relevant context for the request.

  ## Important note

  The summary includes an indicator of whether the referrer has authorised the providing organisation to 
  convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request. 
  If authorised, [[HYPERLINK_A027]] can be used to convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request.

  An advice and guidance request may have been converted to a referral (with the same UBRN), 
  and in addition a referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. As such, 
  it is important that all clinical information is obtained across all the related UBRNs in the pathway. 
  These may be identified using [[HYPERLINK_A005]] and will be returned if the user is authorised to view this.

  If the converted advice and guidance request is referred to a service outside of your organisation, 
  the subsequent referral information may not be accessible due to existing data-access rules. However, 
  the advice and guidance summary ([[HYPERLINK_A024]]), attachments ([[HYPERLINK_A006]]), advice and guidance conversation ([[HYPERLINK_A025]]) and 
  clinical information ([[HYPERLINK_A043]]) which took place before such a conversion still forms part of the clinical information and can still be retrieved.

  ## Related endpoints

  After using this endpoint, use [[HYPERLINK_A025]] to retrieve the Advice and Guidance conversation itself.
