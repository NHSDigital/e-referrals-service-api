  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. This endpoint provides important 
  contextual information about the advice and guidance request (e.g. the service/specialty to which advice has been requested, etc).

  This does not include the actual advice and guidance conversation between the referrer and the service provider. 
  The conversation can be retrieved via [[HYPERLINK_A025]].

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. 
  For service provider users, you may have identified the UBRN via [[HYPERLINK_A023]].

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request

  So I can understand all of the relevant context for the request.

  ## Important note

  The summary includes an indicator of whether the referrer has authorised the providing organisation to 
  convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request. 
  If authorised, [[HYPERLINK_A027]] can be used to convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request.
