  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve the advice and guidance conversation between the referring organisation 
  and service providing organisation.

  A 'conversation' takes the form of the messages between a referrer (seeking advice) and a provider or specialist. Messages can include attachments.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. For service provider users, 
  you may have identified the UBRN via [[HYPERLINK_A023]].

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. 
  This will importantly include the latest version of the request which must be used.

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve the conversation that is present on an advice and guidance request

  So that I can review the conversation and potentially contribute further to it.

  ## Important note

  The conversation returned includes links to any attachments associated with the conversation.

  ## Related endpoints

  After using this endpoint:
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve any attachments associated with the advice and guidance request.
    - (For service provider users) Use [[HYPERLINK_A026]] to respond to the referrer supplying advice or requesting further information.
    - (For service provider users) Use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. This is only possible if the referrer has authorised the provider to do so.

  Use [[HYPERLINK_A043]] to generate a PDF file overview relating to an advice and guidance request.
