  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to retrieve the advice and guidance conversation between the referring organisation 
  and service providing organisation.

  A 'conversation' takes the form of the messages between a referrer (seeking advice) and a provider or specialist. Messages can include attachments.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Application-restricted access, unattended access
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. For service provider users, 
  you may have identified the UBRN via [[HYPERLINK_A023]].

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. 
  This will importantly include the latest version of the request which must be used.

  ## Application-restricted access

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application, working in the context of a Service Provider Organisation.

  ## Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user or application

  I need to retrieve the conversation that is present on an advice and guidance request

  So that I can review the conversation and potentially contribute further to it.

  ## Important notes

  The conversation returned includes links to any attachments associated with the conversation.
  This can be done via endpoint [[HYPERLINK_A006]]. 
  Note, dependent on how attachments were added they may be linked to the Advice and Guidance summary instead of the conversation. 
  These may be retrieved from [[HYPERLINK_A024]].

  If the converted advice and guidance request is referred to a service outside of your organisation, 
  the subsequent referral information may not be accessible due to existing data-access rules. 
  However, the advice and guidance summary ([[HYPERLINK_A024]]), attachments ([[HYPERLINK_A006]]), 
  advice and guidance conversation ([[HYPERLINK_A025]]) and 
  clinical information ([[HYPERLINK_A043]]) which took place before such a conversion still forms part of the clinical information and can still be retrieved.
  The conversation also gets included in the form of a PDF file returned by [[HYPERLINK_A007]].

  In order to retrieve an attachment using the [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]) endpoint, the attachment must be available for download. Attachments are only made available once an uploaded file has been validated and successfully malware scanned. A request to retrieve an attachment that is not available for download will result in an error being returned. See [[HYPERLINK_A042]] for more information.

  The availability status of an attachment can be retrieved via any endpoint that returns an eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code in the success response, including [[HYPERLINK_A025]]. The eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code can return one of four possible values, as detailed below.

  | eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code | Description / Guidance                                                                                             |
  |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | AVAILABLE	                    | The file is available for download.                                                                                |
  | PENDING	                      | The file is being scanned and cannot be retrieved. Wait at least 5 minutes before checking its availability again. |
  | THREATS_FOUND	                | The file has been quarantined after detecting a threat and cannot be retrieved.<br>Contact the organisation that uploaded the file to resolve the issue and get the information you need. Use the extensions returned via this endpoint: Extension-eRS-AttachedBy-1 and Extension-eRS-AttachedByOrganisation-1. |
  | VALIDATION_FAILED             | The file has failed validation and cannot be retrieved.<br>Contact the organisation that uploaded the file to resolve the issue and get the information you need. Use the extensions returned via this endpoint: Extension-eRS-AttachedBy-1 and Extension-eRS-AttachedByOrganisation-1. Validation can fail because the:<ul><li>content type of the file is not supported</li><li>content type of the file does not correlate with the file extension</li><li>file provided is too large and is not supported by e-RS. Note, this indicates that the file size is larger than the system supports as a whole, not the 5MB limit associated with this endpoint</li></ul> |



  ## Related endpoints

  After using this endpoint:
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve any attachments associated with the advice and guidance request.
    - (For service provider users) Use [[HYPERLINK_A026]] to respond to the referrer supplying advice or requesting further information.
    - (For service provider users) Use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. This is only possible if the referrer has authorised the provider to do so.

  Use [[HYPERLINK_A043]] to generate a PDF file overview relating to an advice and guidance request.
