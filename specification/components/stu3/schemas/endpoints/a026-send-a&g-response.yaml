  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to respond to an advice and guidance request your service provider organisation has received. 
  You can either provide guidance back to the referrer or request further information from the referrer. 
  This will return the advice and guidance request back to the referrer for action.

  Note:  If you want to convert an advice and guidance request into a referral, 
  and provide a final guidance response back to the referrer at the same time, please 
  use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] instead. This option is only permissible 
  if the referrer has authorised the provider to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral.

  Whilst a document can be uploaded via [[HYPERLINK_A020]] without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID`, only documents that have a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` can be associated using this end point. 
  An attempt to associate a document without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` will return an error response of 422 - `INAPPROPRIATE_VALUE`.
  
  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A025]] to retrieve the conversation within an advice and guidance request.

  If you want to include attachments with the response, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so they are ready to be associated with the response.
  
  ## Important notes
               
  In order to retrieve an attachment using the [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]) endpoint, the attachment must be available for download.
  The availability status of attachments associated with a referral are returned via this endpoint as a eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code.
               
  Further details on attachment availability status and eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 codes can be found in the [[HYPERLINK_A005]] and [[HYPERLINK_A042]] specifications.

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to return an advice and guidance request back to the referrer with some guidance
