  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to respond to an advice and guidance request your service provider organisation has received. 
  You can either provide guidance back to the referrer or request further information from the referrer. 
  This will return the advice and guidance request back to the referrer for action.

  Note:  If you want to convert an advice and guidance request into a referral, 
  and provide a final guidance response back to the referrer at the same time, please 
  use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] instead. This option is only permissible 
  if the referrer has authorised the provider to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral.
