  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to:
    - convert the advice and guidance request you have received into a referral, AND
    - create a task for the service provider admin team to select/shortlist appropriate services for the patient, AND
    - provide final guidance response details back to the referrer
  
  Note: This endpoint is only allowed to be used if the referrer has authorised the provider to convert the advice 
  and guidance request into a referral.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. 
  This will include whether or not the referrer has authorised the provider to be able to convert an 
  advice and guidance request into a referral, and thus dictate whether this endpoint can be used.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A025]] to retrieve the conversation within an advice and guidance request.

  If you want to include attachments with the admin task and/or the response to the referrer, 
  you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to convert an inbound advice and guidance request into a referral 
  and task my admin team to shortlist appropriate services for the patient

  So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.

  ## Important notes

  When this endpoint is successfully used, an entry will be added to the service providers 
  Appointments For Booking worklist for the admin team to action the task. The provider 
  admin team will currently only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional 
  Application user interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).
