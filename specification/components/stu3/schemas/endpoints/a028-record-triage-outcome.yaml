  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to record a triage outcome for the following referrals awaiting review:
    - referrals sent into a triage service
    - referrals deferred into a directly bookable service because of appointment slot unavailability

  Whilst a document can be uploaded via [[HYPERLINK_A020]] without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID`, only documents that have a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` can be associated using this end point. 
  An attempt to associate a document without a `NHSD-eRS-Referral-ID` will return an error response of 422 - `INAPPROPRIATE_VALUE`.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  - Application-restricted, unattended access

  ## Pre-requisites
  ### Application-restricted, unattended access 
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS calling application, working in the context of a Service Provider Organisation.
  
  To access this endpoint in application-restricted, unattended mode, you will be required to submit your use case for review. The only use case currently permitted is for non-clinical provider actions.

  ### Healthcare worker, user-restricted access
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
  
  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. 
  [[HYPERLINK_A028]] can only be used for referrals sent into triage services, and not the referrals 
  booked into bookable services.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve the contents of the 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist. 
  This provides a list of referrals that have been deferred into directly bookable services.

    - Referrals from this worklist may already have been reviewed or may not have any referral clinical information associated, 
    in which case [[HYPERLINK_A028]] cannot be used.
    - [[HYPERLINK_A028]] can only be used for those referrals, on the 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist, which are pending review.
    - As such, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A029]] to determine if [[HYPERLINK_A028]] is a permissible action.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve the details for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A007]] to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

  If you want to include attachments with the triage outcome, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so 
  they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

  ## Use cases
  As an authenticated user

  I need to return the referral back to the referrer with some advice

  So that I can progress the patient's care appropriately with the referrer.


  As an authenticated user

  I need to accept the referral and task my admin team to shortlist appropriate services for the patient

  So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.


  ## Important notes

    - The only outcomes that are supported by this endpoint are 'Return to referrer with advice' and 'Accept and refer/book later'. 'Refer/book now' is not supported.
    - The triage comment text is mandatory. This comment provided will be sent to:
      - The initial referrer when the 'Return to referrer with advice' triage outcome is chosen.
      - An administrator at the receiving service provider when the 'Accept and refer/book later' outcome is chosen.
    - The priority of the referral can be changed as part of recording the triage outcome
    - When this endpoint is successfully used for recording an outcome of 'Accept and refer/book later', 
    an entry will be added to the service providers Appointments For Booking worklist for the admin team to action the task. 
    The provider admin team will only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional Application user 
    interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).
    - In order to retrieve an attachment using the [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]) endpoint, the attachment must be available for download. 
    The availability status of attachments associated with a referral are returned via this endpoint as a eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code.
      - Further details on attachment availability status and eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 codes can be found in the [[HYPERLINK_A005]] and [[HYPERLINK_A042]] specifications.
