  ## Overview
  This endpoint allows an authenticated e-RS user to check ahead of performing an action, 
  whether or not the action is permitted. This endpoint performs a search for available and 
  supported actions that can be *currently* performed, by the *current* e-RS user on a *specific* 
  referral. When a permitted action is returned, the e-RS user could immediately attempt to 
  perform a permitted action.

  You SHOULD NOT cache the list of available user actions returned because this endpoint 
  gives the *current* actions for the *current* e-RS user, for the referral in context and is therefore, 
  transient; a future call for a different e-RS user, referral, or at a different point in time, 
  might result in a different set of actions, leading to potential failure flows.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites

  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You should obtain a `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) before using this endpoint, as the current UBRN version is required.

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I want to know what actions I might currently perform on a referral prior to attempting to do so

  So that I can review my options, and do not try to persist a prohibited action

  ## Related endpoints

  To retrieve pertinent details relating to a referral:
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve the details of the referral, UBRN and UBRN version.

  Below is a list of actions that could be returned by calling [[HYPERLINK_A029]]
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A028]] to record a review outcome based on the available clinical information and attachments.
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A016]] to Book, or if unable, Defer, an appointment to a specific service on the current shortlist.
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A031]] to change the shortlist of bookable services on an existing referral.
    - Use [[HYPERLINK_A032]] to change the shortlist to a single triage service and refer the patient directly to that triage service.
