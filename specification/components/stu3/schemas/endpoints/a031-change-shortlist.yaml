  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to change the shortlist of bookable services on an existing referral.

  Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist triage services. In order to make use of triage services please use [[HYPERLINK_A032]].

  A patient can request assistance at a service (e.g. a translator, transport or advocacy) when a shortlist is created within the e-RS web application, meaning that all services shortlisted would support the patient's additional requirements to attend.

  The e-RS APIs do not currently support patients' additional requirements so you can neither specify services that support patients' additional requirements, arrange additional requirements for a patient, or view comments associated with the request for additional requirements.

  You must consider if you are fully meeting the patient's additional requirement needs if there are additional requirements associated with the referral.

  If you do not know whether the patient has an existing additional requirement need and the referral may have been shortlisted within the e-RS web application, be mindful that if you chose to amend the shortlist via changing the services, you could remove this patient need.

  If you are changing services to send the patient to a triage service, the triaging service will not support additional requirements but will need to consider if the patient has any additional requirements as part of their decision for future care.

  You can view additional requirements on a referral via the e-RS web application or by fetching [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

  ## Supported security patterns

  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to change the shortlist of bookable services on an existing referral

  So that I can adequately manage my patients referral pathway, allowing the patient to book into an appropriate service.

  ## Related endpoints
  To allow the patient to book their appointment in their own time, you can generate a letter for the patient by using [[HYPERLINK_A019]]. The letter summarises the current state of the referral and any steps the patient may need to follow (e.g. appointment booking instructions).

  You can book an appointment for the patient by using [[HYPERLINK_A015]] and [[HYPERLINK_A016]].

  For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].

  You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], [[HYPERLINK_A007]], and [[HYPERLINK_A006]] endpoints where necessary.
