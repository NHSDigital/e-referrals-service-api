  ## Overview
  **This endpoint has now been deprecated please use [[HYPERLINK_A031]] instead.**
  
  Use this endpoint to change the shortlist to a single triage service and refer the patient directly to that triage service.

  Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist bookable services. In order to shortlist bookable services on an existing referral please use [[HYPERLINK_A031]].

  A patient can request assistance at a service (e.g. a translator, transport or advocacy) when a shortlist is created within the e-RS web application, meaning that all services shortlisted would support the patient's additional requirements to attend.

  The e-RS APIs do not currently support patients' additional requirements so you can neither specify services that support patients' additional requirements, arrange additional requirements for a patient, or view comments associated with the request for additional requirements.

  You must consider if you are fully meeting the patient's additional requirement needs if there are additional requirements associated with the referral.

  If you do not know whether the patient has an existing additional requirement need and the referral may have been shortlisted within the e-RS web application, be mindful that if you chose to amend the shortlist via changing the services, you could remove this patient need.

  If you are changing services to send the patient to a triage service, the triaging service will not support additional requirements but will need to consider if the patient has any additional requirements as part of their decision for future care.

  You can view additional requirements on a referral via the e-RS web application or by fetching [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

  You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]].

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to change the shortlist and refer the patient to a triage service for assessment

  So that I can put the patient on the appropriate clinical pathway for the chosen service provider.

  ## Related endpoints
  For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].

  You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], [[HYPERLINK_A006]], and [[HYPERLINK_A007]] endpoints where necessary.

  You can calculate the date when the patient will need to be contacted (by the triage service) using reference data from [[HYPERLINK_A004]].
