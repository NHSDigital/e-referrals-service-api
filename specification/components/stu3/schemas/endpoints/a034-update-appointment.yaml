  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to cancel an appointment that is booked into a directly-bookable service. Appointments made to directly-bookable services always have a date and time. You can only ever update the current appointment, i.e. an appointment that is related to a service on the current shortlist *and* the most recent appointment made.

  Currently, this endpoint only allows cancellation of an appointment as an update. Future developments may permit further updates.

  To cancel the referral, use [[HYPERLINK_A036]].

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You must use [[HYPERLINK_A004]] to retrieve reference data from the set `APPOINTMENT-CANCELLATION-REASON`.

  To find out which reference data from this set can be used to cancel an appointment, filter as follows:

    - *usage* must be `CANCEL`,
    - *businessFunction* must be `REFERRING_CLINICIAN` or `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` (depending which authenticated user will be performing the action),
    - *effectiveFrom* must be in the past, and
    - *effectiveTo* must not be in the past

  Both the appointment reference, and version, are needed to update an appointment:

  You must use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to obtain the current appointment reference (via *Extension-eRS-Appointment-Reference-1*).

  You must use [[HYPERLINK_A038]] to obtain the current appointment and get the current appointment's version. 

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to update the current appointment

  So that I can manage the patients care appropriately.
