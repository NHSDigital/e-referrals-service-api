  ## Overview
  Use this endpoint to cancel a referral and the current appointment, if there is one. Cancelling a referral is a one-way process and results in an end-state. No further progression of care can occur once this action has been performed.

  A reason for cancelling an appointment must be provided. A comment on the cancellation is conditionally mandatory depending on the reason selected. See pre-requisites and related referrals for more information.

  You can check if you can cancel a referral by calling [[HYPERLINK_A029]].

  e-RS does not allow a referral to be cancelled, without also cancelling the current appointment. Therefore, if there is a current appointment associated with the referral, this *must* be cancelled in advance, or at the same time.

  In order to cancel (only) an appointment you must use [[HYPERLINK_A034]].

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
  - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You must use [[HYPERLINK_A004]] to retrieve a list of reference data, which detail the reason the cancellation is being performed. You can only use reference data from the set `REFERRAL-CANCELLATION-REASON`.


  To find out which reference data from this set can be used, the following filters can be used depending on the cancellation scenario:

  ***1. I want to cancel the referral and the current appointment***

  * Obtain reference data from `REFERRAL-CANCELLATION-REASON` and filter:

    * `referrerUsage` must be `CANCEL_REFERRAL`, and

    * `businessFunction` must be `REFERRING_CLINICIAN` or `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN` (depending which authenticated user will be performing the action), and

    * `canCancelAppointment` must be true, and

    * `effectiveFrom` must be in the past, and 

    * if provided, `effectiveTo` must **not** be in the past


  ***2. I want to cancel a referral, for which there is no current appointment***

  * Obtain reference data from `REFERRAL-CANCELLATION-REASON` and filter:

    * `referrerUsage` must be `CANCEL_REFERRAL`, and

    * `businessFunction` must be `REFERRING_CLINICIAN` or `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`   *(depending which authenticated user will be performing the action), and

    * `canCancelAppointment` could be true or false, and

    * `effectiveFrom` must be in the past, and

    * if provided, `effectiveTo` must **not** be in the past


  You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve details of the referral in order to make this clinical decision.

  ## Use case
  As an authenticated user

  I need to cancel a referral, and any active appointments

  So that the referral is no longer processed

  ## Related endpoints

  You can check if you can cancel the referral by checking [[HYPERLINK_A029]].

  You can use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to obtain a current appointment reference, if there is one. This endpoint will also provide you with the current UBRN version.

  You can use [[HYPERLINK_A038]] to view the current appointment (where applicable).
