  ## Overview
  
  Use this endpoint to generate a PDF file that summarises an advice and guidance request including the conversation. 
  This endpoint cannot be used to obtain a PDF file for a referral request.

  ## Supported security patterns
  - Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Pre-requisites
  In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
    - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of an advice and guidance request.

  ## Important note
  As noted for the [[HYPERLINK_A007]] endpoint that applies to referrals rather than advice and guidance requests, 
  a referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. As such, it is important that all clinical information is obtained from across all the related 
  UBRNs in the pathway as referenced in [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

  An advice and guidance request can only ever exist as a single entity with no related UBRNs *unless* the advice and guidance request is converted to a referral. 
  This can be done via endpoint [[HYPERLINK_A027]]. When the conversion is complete, the advice and guidance request becomes a 
  referral (retaining the same UBRN) and continues its existence as such. Meaning that it may gain related referrals.

  The advice and guidance conversation that took place before such a conversion still forms part of the clinical information. 
  This conversation *does* get included in the PDF file returned by [[HYPERLINK_A007]].

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user

  I need to retrieve a PDF file overview of the advice and guidance request

  So that I can assess its content and decide what further action may be needed.

  ## Related endpoints
  You can retrieve a PDF overview for an advice and guidance request that has been converted to a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A007]].

  You can retrieve structured information about advice and guidance using [[HYPERLINK_A024]] and [[HYPERLINK_A025]].

  You can retrieve a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

  You can retrieve clinical attachments that are associated with a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A006]].
