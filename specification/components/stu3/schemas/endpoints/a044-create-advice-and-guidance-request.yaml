  ## Overview

  Use this endpoint to create an advice and guidance request from a referring organisation to a service providing organisation.

  An advice and guidance request includes important contextual information. For example, the service and specialty to which advice has been requested. Creating the request also starts the conversation between a referrer seeking advice and a provider from whom the advice is sought.

  Conversation messages can include attachments.

  ## Supported security patterns

  Healthcare worker, user-restricted access

  ## Important notes

  The maximum number of services allowed on a given shortlist is 1.
  
  In order to retrieve an attachment using the [[HYPERLINK_A042]] (or deprecated [[HYPERLINK_A006]]) endpoint, the attachment must be available for download. 
  The availability status of attachments associated with a referral are returned via this endpoint as a eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 code. 
  
  Further details on attachment availability status and eRS-AvailabilityStatus-1 codes can be found in the [[HYPERLINK_A024]], [[HYPERLINK_A025]] and [[HYPERLINK_A042]] specifications.

  ## Pre-requisites
  To use this endpoint, you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
    - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

  You need to have identified a patient, for example via [[HYPERLINK_PDS]].

  You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]].

  If you want to include attachments with the request, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so they are ready to be associated with the request.

  ## Use case

  As an authenticated user 

  I need to request some advice from a given service

  So I can either initiate my patient's referral pathway or provide recommended treatment.
