  The NHS e-Referral Service (e-RS) implements pessimistic locking functionality in order to prevent multiple users/systems attempting to update the same resource at the same time.

  The e-RS API automatically acquires the lock on the behalf of the caller, within the scope of the request. When an endpoint call is received to update a resource, that resource will be locked for the duration of the request.

  API callers should not attempt to make simultaneous requests to update the same resource. Any attempt to do so will result in a 423 (Locked) response. If a 423 response is received, then another system/user may be in the process of updating the resource. It will be necessary to fetch the resource again and re-try the request at a later time.
