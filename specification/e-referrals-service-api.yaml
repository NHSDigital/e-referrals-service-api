  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to create paperless referrals from primary to secondary care with the [e-Referral Service (e-RS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service).

    As a primary care referrer, you can:

      -	create a new e-referral
      - search for relevant patient services to create a shortlist
      -	access existing e-referrals
      -	create a triage request for the Referral Assessment Service (RAS)
      -	upload and manage a patient letter or attachments, linking them to a referral
      -	retrieve appointment slots and book appointments
      -	defer a booking to a provider if an appointment slot is unavailable

    As a secondary care provider, you can:

      -	access referrals as a worklist
      -	retrieve non-clinical information (meta-data) about the referral
      -	retrieve attachments which are linked to a referral or triage (RAS) request
      -	retrieve clinical information which has been provided by a referrer
      -	accept or reject a referral request
      -	retrieve Advice & Guidance (A&G) conversations and send responses
      -	convert Advice & Guidance (A&G) conversations into a referral

    You cannot currently use this API to:

      -	get patient details â€“ instead, use the [[HYPERLINK_PDS]]

    You can access the following data:

      -	referral attachments
      -	referral letters
      -	appointment slots
      -	worklists for referral requests
      -	worklists for triage (RAS) requests
      -	worklists for Advice and Guidance (A&G) requests
      -	conversation histories for Advice and Guidance (A&G) requests


    ### Access modes
    
    ##### Users within the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) who have smartcards

    This access mode is in production and [[HYPERLINK_STABLE]]. 
    This access mechanism is documented on the older ['API Hub' documentation portal](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/getstarted_get_connected.html). 
    Using this authentication mechanism allows full use of all e-RS endpoints. 
    This access mode requires the creation of a professional session and selection of a role in order to authenticate.
    
    ##### Users without access to the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), or without access to smartcards

    e-RS has recently released a new solution which allows authentication over the internet, 
    using [NHS Care Identity Service 2 (CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-cis2). 
    The documentation you are currently reading must be used when you wish to authenticate over the internet. 
    Not every endpoint is available yet: we have only released the endpoints you see listed below in the Endpoints section below. 
    This access mode requires the use of [[HYPERLINK_A030]] endpoint to authenticate. 
    Please note that this is currently in [[HYPERLINK_BETA]], 
    meaning we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it.

    ## Who can use this API

    You can use this API if you are a software developer wishing to interact with the e-referrals service (e-RS) data. 

    To use this API:

      -	you must have justification for doing so
      -	you must register with the [e-RS Partners Service](https://developer-test.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/getstarted_partner_registration.html)
      -	as an e-RS Partner, we offer you guidance and support for onboarding via the e-RS Partners Service which can be contacted via emailing [nhserspartners@nhs.net](mailto:nhserspartners@nhs.net)
      -	you must [assure](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/assure_compliance_approach.html) your solution before we grant access to live data
      -	clinical safety remains your responsibility (and the responsibility of your end user organisations), as laid out in the NHS e-RS Integration API [compliance approach](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/assure_compliance_approach.html)

    See the [[HYPERLINK_ONBOARDING]] section below for more information.


    ## Related APIs

    The following API also gives access to the e-referrals service (e-RS) data:

      - [e-RS FHIR v2 API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/explore_endpoint_catalogue.html) - this is deprecated and we plan to retire it. Do not integrate with this API


    ## API status and roadmap

    The e-RS FHIR STU3 API is [[HYPERLINK_STABLE]], when accessed via HSCN network with a smartcard. 

    The e-RS FHIR STU3 API is in [[HYPERLINK_BETA]] when accessed via the internet 
    using [[HYPERLINK_CIS2]]. There is also one FHIR R4 endpoint, [[HYPERLINK_A030]] endpoint, as part of our beta. 
    We plan to move more endpoints into the FHIR R4 standard in the future, as part of 
    our [roadmap](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service/the-future-of-the-nhs-e-referral-service#future-service-roadmap). 

    For the current e-RS roadmap see [the future of the NHS e-referral service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service/the-future-of-the-nhs-e-referral-service#future-service-roadmap).

    ## Technology

    This API is primarily [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest) 
    and based on [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standards for health care data exchange.

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    To use this API with NHS smartcards you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).


    ## Security and authorisation

    For users with access to the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network), 
    access is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), 
    meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.

    The end user must also be:

      -	a healthcare worker
      -	strongly authenticated using an NHS smartcard

    For more details see [Authentication and Authorisation](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/develop_business_flow_bf001.html).

    If you wish to authenticate users without smartcards, access is still [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) 
    but uses the following security patterns instead:

      -	[user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - combined authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-combined-authentication-and-authorisation)
      -	[user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS CIS2 - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    | Environment       | Base URL                                                               |
    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/referrals/FHIR` |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/referrals/FHIR` |
    | Production        | Not yet available |

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
      -	is for early developer testing
      -	only covers a limited set of scenarios
      -	is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates
      -	is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    Try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    The sandbox will only respond to an input which exactly matches one of the examples provided; it is otherwise stateless.

    ### Integration testing

    Our integration test environment:

      -	is for formal integration testing
      - is where we will conduct witness testing for your application
      -	is stateful, so data will be persisted

    ## Onboarding

    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. 
    The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it's worth planning well ahead.

    To onboard for this API, follow 
    the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) process](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process).

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to create a referral by choosing a shortlist of bookable services.

        Please note: this endpoint cannot be used to shortlist triage services. In order to make use of triage services please use [[HYPERLINK_A021]].

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
        
        You need to have identified a `patient`, for example via [[HYPERLINK_PDS]].

        You need to have found services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]].

        ## Use case
        As an authenticated user

        I need to create a shortlist of bookable services

        So I can initiate my patients referral pathway, allowing the patient to book into one of the shortlisted services.

        ## Related endpoints

        To allow the patient to book their appointment in their own time, you can generate a letter for the patient by 
        using [[HYPERLINK_A019]]. The letter summarises the current state of the referral and any steps the 
        patient may need to follow (e.g. appointment booking instructions).

        You can book an appointment for the patient by using [[HYPERLINK_A015]] and [[HYPERLINK_A016]].

        For the referral to be processed by the service provider, you must ensure appropriate referral letter information has been added to the referral. You can add/manage referrer letter information by using [A012 - Maintain referral letter](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/e-Referrals/explore_endpoint_a012.html).

        You can check to see what referral letter information has already been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], [[HYPERLINK_A007]], and [[HYPERLINK_A006]] endpoints where necessary.

        So I can use it with other endpoints or display the reference data in a user-friendly format to my users.
        
        ## Related endpoints
        Reference data may be needed for other endpoints, for example when including Specialty and Clinic Type reference data to:
        - find services that meet the referral needs of a patient using [[HYPERLINK_A010]], and
        - create a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A011]] or [[HYPERLINK_A021]]
        
        You may also wish to present the user-friendly names for the reference data, for example when viewing the referral using [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve available appointment slots for a service.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`

        You need to have identified a directly bookable `service` that is on the current referral shortlist. You can do this by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]].

        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve a list of available appointment slots for a service

        So that I can offer them to the patient for booking.

        ## Important note
        You need to provide the 'commissioning rule organisation' when calling A015 - Retrieve appointment slots to ensure only suitable slots are returned. You can obtain the 'commissioning rule organisation' from [[HYPERLINK_A005]].
        
        ## Related endpoints

        You can book an appointment to an available slot using [[HYPERLINK_A016]].

        You can defer booking to a directly bookable service using [[HYPERLINK_A016]] but only in the following circumstances:
          - when the service has no available slots
          - when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available
          - when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)

        ## Overview
        
        Use this endpoint to upload a file containing clinical information to e-RS ready to be associated with a referral.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`

        You can only upload file formats that are supported by e-RS. Currently, the supported file formats are:

        | File type          | File extension(s)           |
        | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
        | Plain Text         | `.txt`                      |

        | MSWORD             | `.doc`, `.docx`             |

        Currently, the maximum file size supported by e-RS is 5MB.

        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user

        I need to upload a referral letter or other clinical information file to e-RS

        So that I can associate the file with an existing referral.

        ## Important notes:

        This endpoint **only** performs the file upload. The uploaded file is **not** associated with a referral until the file has been associated with a referral, for example using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].
        
        The resulting URL within e-RS for the uploaded file is returned in the 'Location' header of the response.

        ## Related endpoints

        You can associate the uploaded file with a specific referral using [[HYPERLINK_A012]].

        ## Overview
        
        Use this endpoint to retrieve a file that is attached to a referral or advice request.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`

        You need to have retrieved the referral via [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to obtain the URLs for its attachments.

        ## Important note

        A referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. 
        For example, a referral is booked and seen in a general knee clinical assessment service (UBRN #1), 
        and the service decides to onward refer to a more specialist knee miniscus service (UBRN #2). 
        This would result in two UBRNs for the referral pathway in this example (but there could be more related UBRNs if onward referred multiple times).

        As such, it is important that all clinical information is obtained from across all the related UBRNs referenced in [[HYPERLINK_A005]]. 
        You can do this using the following endpoints:

          - [[HYPERLINK_A007]]
          - A006 - Retrieve Attachment

        Note: It is possible that the initial UBRN may be the only one in the referral pathway to have clinical information and/or attachments associated.
        
        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve a clinical attachment associated with a referral

        So that I can assess its content and decide what further action may be needed.

        ## Related endpoints

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to manage the set of 'referral letter' attachments associated with an existing referral, including adding or removing attachments from a referral.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
        
        All new files to be associated with a referral must be uploaded first using [[HYPERLINK_A020]] and then linked to the referral using this endpoint.

        ## Important information about using this endpoint
        
        This endpoint can be used to associate attachments to a referral that has no existing referral letter attachments. 
        In this case you must upload the file first using [[HYPERLINK_A020]] and then associate it to the referral using this endpoint.

        You can also use this endpoint to modify the *set* of referral letter attachments already associated with a referral. 
        In this case, you must post all referral letter attachments you wish to be (finally) associated to the referral, 
        including any that were already associated. In other words, this endpoint replaces the set of referral letter 
        attachments previously associated - with those specified in your latest request. 
        As such, it is imperative that this call references all the attachments the user wishes to keep, every time it is called.

        Below are three example scenarios which clarify the behaviour of the endpoint when referral attachments are already present on the referral:

        1. Let us consider a referral that has two referral letter attachments associated (say "A.pdf" and "B.pdf"). If 
        you wish to add an additional attachment (say "C.pdf"), you must upload the additional attachment 
        "C.pdf" using [[HYPERLINK_A020]], and then associate attachments "A.pdf", "B.pdf" and "C.pdf" 
        via this endpoint in a single request. That is, all three attachments "A.pdf", "B.pdf" and "C.pdf" 
        must be included in the request to A012 - Maintain referral letter.
        2. Let us consider a different referral that has two referral letter attachments (say "D.jpg" and "E.jpg") 
        already associated, and you wish to remove one of them. Lets consider that you wish to remove "D.jpg". 
        To do this, you would call A012 - Maintain referral letter specifying only "E.jpg" in your request. By omitting 
        "D.jpg" from your request, e-RS will dis-associate attachment "D.jpg" from the referral and only attachment "E.jpg" 
        will remain associated.
        3. Let us now consider a referral that has four referral letter attachments associated (say "L.doc", "M.doc", "N.doc" 
        and "O.doc"), and you wish to add some more files (say "P.doc" and "Q.doc") and remove some files (say "N.doc" 
        and "O.doc"). To do this you must upload the additional attachment(s) ("N.doc" and "O.doc") 
        using [[HYPERLINK_A020]]. Following that successful upload, you must then associate only all 
        referral letter attachments the user wishes to keep (namely "L.doc", "M.doc", "P.doc" and "Q.doc") 
        in a single request to A012 - Maintain referral letter. Attachments not included in the request 
        (namely "N.doc" and "O.doc") will be dis-associated from the referral as a result.

        As a developer or software supplier, please ensure your users are made aware or protected from this behaviour. 
        For example, when a referring user wants to update the attachments on a referral, the user should be presented 
        with the currently associated attachments so they can add and/or remove attachments as required.

        Note: It is not permissible to remove *all* referral letter attachments leaving zero attachments associated. 
        There must be at least one referral letter attachment associated.

        ## Use case
        As an authenticated user

        I need to be able to manage referral letter attachments associated with a referral

        So I can ensure the service provider has enough information to review/process the referral.


        ## Related endpoints
        Documents must be uploaded into the e-RS document store using [[HYPERLINK_A020]] before they can be associated 
        with a referral.
        
        You can check to see what referral letter information has been added to a referral by using [[HYPERLINK_A005]], 
        [[HYPERLINK_A007]], and [[HYPERLINK_A006]] endpoints where necessary.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to book an appointment to a service if an appointment slot is available or defer booking if no appointment slot is available.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
        
        You need to retrieve available appointment slots for a service using [[HYPERLINK_A015]].

        You need to use the 'Unique Booking Reference Number' (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

        ## Important note when deferring to provider
        
        You should only defer booking to a directly bookable service in the following circumstances:
          - when the service has no available slots *or*
          - when trying to book an appointment into a service, the slot advertised is no longer available *or*
          - when trying to book an appointment into a service, no response is received within the message timeout period (currently 2 minutes)

        ## Use case
        As an authenticated user

        I need to either:
          - book an appointment to an available appointment slot for a service *or*
          - defer booking responsibility for the service to the service provider if a booking is not possible

        So I can progress my patient's care at that service.

        ## Related endpoints
        You can generate a letter for the patient, summarising the current state of their referral and any steps 
        the patient may need to follow using [[HYPERLINK_A019]].

        ## Overview
        
        Use this endpoint to generate a PDF file that summarises clinical information for a referral.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`

        You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of a referral request in order to use this endpoint.

        ## Important note
        A referral pathway in e-RS can be made up of more than one UBRN. For example, a referral is booked and seen in a general knee clinical assessment service (UBRN #1), 
        and the service decides to onward refer to a more specialist knee miniscus service (UBRN #2). This would result in two UBRNs for the referral pathway 
        in this example (but there could be more related UBRNs if onward referred multiple times).

        As such, it is important that all clinical information is obtained from across all the related UBRNs referenced in [[HYPERLINK_A005]]. 
        You can do this using the following endpoints:
          - A007 - Retrieve Clinical Information
          - [[HYPERLINK_A006]]

        Note: It is possible that the initial UBRN may be the only one in the referral pathway to have clinical information and/or attachments associated.

        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve a clinical information summary (in PDF format) associated with the referral

        So that I can assess its content and decide what further action may be needed.

        ## Related endpoints
        You can retrieve clinical attachments that are associated with a referral using [[HYPERLINK_A006]].

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve available worklists of referral requests. Use [[HYPERLINK_A023]] to retrieve available worklists of 
        advice and guidance requests. 

        Worklists provide lists of referral/advice requests that meet certain criteria, 
        typically where a user needs to be aware of something important, or to undertake an action, in order to avoid delays to patient care.

        Service provider organisations can currently access the following referral related worklists:
          - The 'Referrals for Review' worklist contains booked and RAS (triage) referrals that require review by the service provider organisation
          - The 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist contains referrals which have been 'deferred to provider' because of a lack of appointment availability (e.g. no appointment slots). 
          The referrals need to be reviewed and if appropriate booked into a service at the service provider organisation.
        
        There are currently no referral related worklists available for referring organisations.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_ADMIN`
        
        ## Use case
        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve a referral worklist

        So that I can determine which referrals I need to take further action on

        ## Related endpoints

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve available worklists of advice and guidance requests. Use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve available worklists of referral requests.

        Worklists provide lists of referral/advice requests that meet certain criteria, typically where a user needs to be aware of something important, 
        or to undertake an action, in order to avoid delays to patient care.
        
        Service provider organisations can retrieve the contents of their 'Advice and guidance requests' worklist using 
        this endpoint. This worklist contains advice and guidance requests the provider has received and which need actioning.

        There are currently no advice and guidance related worklists available for referring organisations.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_ADMIN`
        
        ## Use case
        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve a worklist of advice and guidance requests

        So I can determine which ones I need to take further action on.

        ## Related endpoints

        Having used this endpoint to retrieve the 'Advice and Guidance Requests' worklist, entries from it can be used as follows:
          - Use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve contextual summary details of the advice and guidance request
          - Use [[HYPERLINK_A025]] to retrieve the conversation within the advice and guidance request, including references to attachments
          - Use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve clinical attachments for an advice and guidance request
          - Use [[HYPERLINK_A026]] to respond to the referrer supplying advice or requesting further information
          - Use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. This is only possible if the referrer has authorised the provider to do so

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. This endpoint provides important 
        contextual information about the advice and guidance request (e.g. the service/specialty to which advice has been requested, etc)

        This does not include the actual advice and guidance conversation between the referrer and the service provider. 
        The conversation can be retrieved via [[HYPERLINK_A025]].

        ## Pre-requisites

        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`

        You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. 
        For service provider users, you may have identified the UBRN via [[HYPERLINK_A023]].

        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request

        So I can understand all of the relevant context for the request.

        ## Important note

        The summary includes an indicator of whether the referrer has authorised the providing organisation to 
        convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request. 
        If authorised, [[HYPERLINK_A027]] can be used to convert the advice and guidance request into an appointment request.

        ## Related endpoints

        After using this endpoint, use [[HYPERLINK_A025]] to retrieve the Advice and Guidance conversation itself.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to retrieve the advice and guidance conversation between the referring organisation 
        and service providing organisation.

        A 'conversation' takes the form of the messages between a referrer (seeking advice) and a provider or specialist. Messages can include attachments.

        ## Pre-requisites

        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN`
          - `REFERRING_CLINICIAN_ADMIN`
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`

        You need to use the `Unique Booking Reference Number` (UBRN) of the advice and guidance request. For service provider users, 
        you may have identified the UBRN via [[HYPERLINK_A023]].

        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. 
        This will importantly include the latest version of the request which must be used.

        ## Use case

        As an authenticated user

        I need to retrieve the conversation that is present on an advice and guidance request

        So that I can review the conversation and potentially contribute further to it.

        ## Important note

        The conversation returned includes links to any attachments associated with the conversation.

        ## Related endpoints

        After using this endpoint:
          - Use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve any attachments associated with the advice and guidance request.
          - (For service provider users) Use [[HYPERLINK_A026]] to respond to the referrer supplying advice or requesting further information.
          - (For service provider users) Use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. This is only possible if the referrer has authorised the provider to do so.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to respond to an advice and guidance request your service provider organisation has received. 
        You can either provide guidance back to the referrer or request further information from the referrer. 
        This will return the advice and guidance request back to the referrer for action.

        Note:  If you want to convert an advice and guidance request into a referral, 
        and provide a final guidance response back to the referrer at the same time, please 
        use [[HYPERLINK_A027]] instead. This option is only permissible 
        if the referrer has authorised the provider to convert the advice and guidance request into a referral. 
        
        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to:
          - convert the advice and guidance request you have received into a referral, AND
          - create a task for the service provider admin team to select/shortlist appropriate services for the patient, AND
          - provide a final guidance response details back to the referrer
        
        Note: This endpoint is only allowed to be used if the referrer has authorised the provider to convert the advice 
        and guidance request into a referral.

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
        
        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A024]] to retrieve the summary of an advice and guidance request. 
        This will include whether or not the referrer has authorised the provider to be able to convert an 
        advice and guidance request into a referral, and thus dictate whether this endpoint can be used.

        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A025]] to retrieve the conversation within an advice and guidance request.

        If you want to include attachments with the admin task and/or the response to the referrer, 
        you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

        ## Use case
        As an authenticated user

        I need to convert an inbound advice and guidance request into a referral 
        and task my admin team to shortlist appropriate services for the patient

        So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.

        ## Important notes

        When this endpoint is successfully used, an entry will be added to the service providers 
        Appointments For Booking worklist for the admin team to action the task. The provider 
        admin team will currently only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional 
        Application user interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).

        ## Related endpoints

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint, as a service provider, to record a triage outcome for the following referrals awaiting review:
          - referrals sent into a triage service
          - referrals deferred into a directly bookable service because of appointment slot unavailability

        ## Pre-requisites
        In order to use this endpoint you must be an authenticated e-RS user and use one of the following e-RS roles:
          - `SERVICE_PROVIDER_CLINICIAN`
        
        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A008]] to retrieve the contents of the 'Referrals For Review' worklist. 
        [[HYPERLINK_A028]] can only be used for referrals sent into triage services, and not the referrals 
        booked into bookable services.
          - Referrals from this worklist may already have been reviewed or may not have any referral clinical information associated, 
          in which case [[HYPERLINK_A028]] cannot be used.
          - [[HYPERLINK_A028]] can only be used for those referrals, on the 'Appointment Slot Issues' worklist, which are pending review.
          - As such, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A029]] to determine if [[HYPERLINK_A028]] is a permissible action.

        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A005]] to retrieve the details for the referral.

        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A006]] to retrieve the clinical attachments for the referral.

        You need to use [[HYPERLINK_A007]] to retrieve the clinical information summary PDF for the referral.

        If you want to include attachments with the triage outcome, you need to use [[HYPERLINK_A020]] so 
        they are ready to be associated when this endpoint is called.

        ## Use cases
        As an authenticated user

        I need to return the referral back to the referrer with some advice

        So that I can progress the patient's care appropriately with the referrer.


        As an authenticated user

        I need to accept the referral and task my admin team to shortlist appropriate services for the patient

        So that I can progress the patient's care along the most appropriate referral pathway.


        ## Important notes

          - The only outcomes that are supported by this endpoint are 'Return to referrer with advice' and 'Accept and refer/book later'. 'Refer/book now' is not supported.
          - The triage comment text is mandatory. This comment provided will be sent to:
            - The initial referrer when the 'Return to referrer with advice' triage outcome is chosen.
            - An administrator at the receiving service provider when the 'Accept and refer/book later' outcome is chosen.
          - The priority of the referral can be changed as part of recording the triage outcome
          - When this endpoint is successfully used for recording an outcome of 'Accept and refer/book later', 
          an entry will be added to the service providers Appointments For Booking worklist for the admin team to action the task. 
          The provider admin team will only be able to progress the referral via the e-RS Professional Application user 
          interface (e.g. shortlisting appropriate services for the patient).
